I have ₹15000K. Explain and add options for the investment in coming two year

I’ve following suggestion

1.  **Equity/Stocks:**

- High growth potential, but higher risk.

- Consider allocating a portion (e.g., ₹6,000K) to diversified stocks or index funds.

2.  **Mutual Funds:**

- Professionally managed, moderate risk.

- Allocate (e.g., ₹3,000K) to balanced or growth mutual funds.

3.  **Fixed Deposits/Bonds:**

- Low risk, stable returns.

- Place (e.g., ₹2,000K) in fixed deposits or government bonds.

4.  **Real Estate:**

- Long-term appreciation, rental income.

- Use (e.g., ₹2,000K) as a down payment or invest in REITs.

5.  **Gold/Commodities:**

- Hedge against inflation, diversify your portfolio.

- Invest (e.g., ₹1,000K) in gold ETFs or sovereign gold bonds.

6.  **Startups/Private Equity:**

- High risk, high reward, less liquid.

- Allocate (e.g., ₹1,000K) to vetted startup opportunities.

**Recommendation:**

Diversify your investment across these options to balance risk and growth. Review your allocations annually and adjust based on market performance and your financial goals.
