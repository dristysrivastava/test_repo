Insider trading refers to buying or selling stocks using confidential, non-public company information.
Material non-public information (MNPI) includes unpublished earnings results, merger plans, acquisitions, leadership changes, or regulatory decisions.

Examples of risky situations:

Buying company shares before a public acquisition announcement.

Trading stocks after learning internal quarterly earnings results.

Sharing confidential financial information with friends or family for trading.

Acting on a tip from an employee who has access to internal company data.

Legal considerations:

Insider trading is illegal in many jurisdictions.

In India, SEBI regulates insider trading under the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations.

Violations may lead to financial penalties, trading bans, or imprisonment.
